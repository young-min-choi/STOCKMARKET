####1. What is Stock?
[Reference site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock)
The __Stock__ (also capital stock) of a corporation is constituted of the equity stock of its owners. A single share of the stock represents fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. In liquidation, __the stock represents the residual assets of the company__ that would be due to stockholders after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt. Stockholders' equity cannot be withdrawn from the company in a way that is intended to be detrimental to the company's creditors.

It should be noted that whether you say shares, equity, or stock, it all means the same thing. 

```
In the easiest words, 
Stock means fraction of ownership of a company. 
```

Then why is stock important?

####3. Basic terms   
[Reference site](http://www.timothysykes.com/2013/06/trading-terms-you-need-to-know/)
> *Understanding basic terms and definition is the essential key to success in any field.*

> *It is like the act of assembling the smallest blocks to build a castle.*
   
   *by Young-Min Choi*


Below is the list of basic terms listed in alphabetical order. 

- Averaging Down: This is when an investor buys more of a stock as the price goes down. This makes it so your average purchase price decreases.

- Beta: A measurement of the relationship between the price of a stock and the movement of the whole market. If stock XYZ has a beta of 1.5, that means that for every 1 point move in the market, stock XYZ moves 1.5 points and vice versa.

- Blue Chip Stocks: These are the large, industry leading companies. They offer a stable record of significant dividend payments and have a reputation of sound fiscal management. The expression is thought to have been derived from blue gambling chips, which is the highest denomination of chips used in casinos.

- Bull Market: This is when the stock market as a whole is in a prolonged period of increasing stock prices. Opposite of a bear market.

- Broker: A person who buys or sells an investment for you in exchange for a fee (a commission). Here is Tim’s favorite broker. (LINK)

- Day Trading: The practice of buying and selling within the same trading day, before the close of the markets on that day. This is what Tim typically does, although he does have a long-term portfolio as well. Traders that participate in day trading are often called “active traders” or “day traders.”

- Dividend: this is a portion of a company’s earnings that is paid to shareholders, or people that own hat company’s stock, on a quarterly or annual basis. Not all company’s do this.

- Exchange: An exchange is a place in which different investments are traded. The most well-known in the United States are the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.

- Execution: When an order to buy or sell has been completed. If you put in an order to sell 100 shares, this means that all 100 shares have been sold.

- Hedge: This is used to limit your losses. You can do this by taking an offsetting position. For example, if you hold 100 shares of XYZ, you could short the stock or futures positions on the stock.

- Index: An index is a benchmark which is used as a reference marker for traders and portfolio managers. A 10% may sound good, but if the market index returned 12%, then you didn’t do very well since you could have just invested in an index fund and saved time by not trading frequently. Examples are the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor’s 500.

- Initial Public Offering (IPO): The first sale or offering of a stock by a company to the public, rather than  just being owned by private or inside investors.

- Margin: A margin account lets a person borrow money (take out a loan essentially) from a broker to purchase an investment. The difference between the amount of the loan, and the price of the securities, is called the margin.

- Moving Average: A stock’s average price-per-share during a specific period of time. Some time frames are 50 and 200 day moving averages.

- Order: An investor’s bid to buy or sell a certain amount of stock or option contracts. You have to put an order in to buy or sell 100 shares of stock.

- Portfolio: A collection of investments owned by an investor. You can have as little as one stock in a portfolio to an infinite amount of stocks.

- Quote: Information on a stock’s latest trading  price. This is sometimes delayed by 20 minutes unless you are using an actual broker trading platform.

- Rally: A rapid increase in the general price level of the market or of the price of a stock.

- Sector: A group of stocks that are in the same business. An example would be the “Technology” sector including companies like Apple and Microsoft.

- Spread: This is the difference between the bid and the ask prices of a stock, or the amount someone is willing to buy it and someone is willing to sell it.

- Stock Symbol: A one-character to three-character, alphabetic root symbol, which represents a publically traded company on a stock exchange. Apple’s stock symbol is AAPL.

- Volatility: This refers to the price movements of a stock or the stock market as a whole. Highly volatile stocks are ones with extreme daily up and down movements and wide intraday trading ranges. This is often common with stocks that are thinly traded, or have low trading volumes. This is also common with the stocks that Tim trades.

- Volume: The number of shares of stock traded during a particular time period, normally measured in average daily trading volume.

- Yield: This usually refers to the measure of the return on an investment that is received from the payment of a dividend. This is determined by dividing the annual dividend amount by the price paid for the stock. If you bought stock XYZ for $40-a-share and it pays a $1.00-per-year dividend, you have a “yield” of 2.5%

#### 4. The Causes of Change in Stock Prices 

There are many factors and theories regarding this subject. 
However, 4 factors mentioned below are fundamental to changing prices of stock. 

- New information
- Uncertainty
- Psychological Factors
   + Fear
   + Greed
- Supply and Demand

If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.

![Supply and Demand](https://preetamsushistory.wikispaces.com/file/view/Supply-and-Demand-Graph.png/339495246/Supply-and-Demand-Graph.png)

Understanding supply and demand is easy. *What is difficult to comprehend is what makes people like a particular stock and dislike another stock.* This comes down to figuring out what news is positive for a company and what news is negative. There are many answers to this problem and just about any investor you ask has their own ideas and strategies.

#### 6. Reflexibility Theory by George Soros

George Soros is one of the most influential figures in the stock market. 

![George Soros](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/George_Soros_47th_Munich_Security_Conference_2011_crop.jpg/230px-George_Soros_47th_Munich_Security_Conference_2011_crop.jpg)

He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. It emphasizes the imperfect understanding of facts by participants as they are part of the situation and repudiates the fundamental assumption made by Classical Economics. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:

1. Reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena. Examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include (a) equity leveraging or (b) the trend-following habits of speculators.

2. Reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions; i.e., the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities.

3. Investors' observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes.

A recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets. 

```
Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses. More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses. Lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that their equity backing the loans – the value of the houses, had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively). Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still.

This was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.
